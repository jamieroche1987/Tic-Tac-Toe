## FINAL DESIGN

## INITIAL IDEA CONCEPT

My initial idea for the project was to create a game of Tic Tac Toe that can be played with friends and family. My target audience is anyone who has an interest in playing tic tac toe with others . I wanted to make the website to stand out with the colors used. I also wanted their to be a score board to keep track of who is winning the most games.

- The Features I wanted the project to have are:

  - To make the site easy read
  - Have a players score board
  - Look appealing with the color scheme
  - Have a pop up message at the end of the game with a button feature to start a new game.

## UX/UI
The game was created to show my knowledge of JAVASCRIPT including, HTML and CSS
To provide users with a game that is easy to play and fun
The user is able to interact with 2/3 clear buttons to play the game
Any interactive buttons should be clear and obvious as to what they do

Site Goals:

To showcase my skills in JAVASCRIPT, HTML and CSS
To provide users with an easy to play game
To provide users with rules on how to play the game
To make the game easily accessible

## USER STORIES
As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the game
As a user, I want the game to be colourful and fun
As a user, I want to see obvious and clear buttons to play the game
As a user, I want to see a score board to see who wins the most games

## REMOTE DEPLOYMENT:

(Assuming you have already cloned or forked)

- This Game was deployed using GitHub Pages with the following the steps:

1. Click on the `Settings` icon at the top of page in the navigation bar
2. Scroll down until you see `Github Pages`
3. There will be a message box saying `Check it out here` Click on the link to take you to the next page
4. Here you will be greated with a form, `Choose the repository` `Tic-Tac-Toe`
5. Choose the branch in the drop down box, in this case `MAIN`
6. Choose the directory in the next drop down box, in this case `Root`
7. Then click `Save`
8. It may take a few moments for the game to publish, but once live, the box at the top of the page with the site name will turn green and have a `Green` tick to the left of the link to the live page
9. Another way to find the live page is to navigate to settings, on the left menu click on `pages` and this will get you to the same point

- These commands were used for version control during project:

  - git add `example filename` - to add files before committing
  - git commit -m `"example message"` - to commit changes to the local repository
  - git push - to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository
  - git branch - to see which branch currently working on
  - git pull - to pull all code into main branch once the feature branch had been merged and deleted
  - git status - to see if the branch currently working on is upto date or if the are any unstaged

## HOW TO CREATE A BRANCH/TAG OF MAIN:
