## SITE PURPOSE

Tic Tac Toe is a website designed to play the classic game of noughts and crosses
[Here is a link to the final project](https://jamieroche1987.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

## FINAL DESIGN

![Final project image](/assets/images/testing/amiresponsive.png) Am i Responsive(https://amiresponsive.co.uk/)

## INITIAL IDEA CONCEPT

- My initial idea for the project was to create a game of Tic Tac Toe that can be played with friends and family
- I wanted to make the website to stand out with the colors used.
- I also wanted their to be a score board to keep track of who is winning the most games.
- My target audience is anyone who has an interest in playing tic tac toe with others

* The Features I wanted the project to have are:

  - To make the site easy read
  - Have a players score board
  - Look appealing with the color scheme
  - Have a pop up message at the end of the game with a button feature to start a new game.

## UX/UI

- The game was created to show my knowledge of JAVASCRIPT including, HTML and CSS
- To provide users with a game that is easy to play and fun
- The user is able to interact with buttons to play the game
- Any interactive buttons should be clear and obvious as to what they do

Site Goals:

- To showcase my skills in JAVASCRIPT, HTML and CSS
- To provide users with an easy to play game
- To provide users with rules on how to play the game
- To make the game easily accessible

## USER STORIES

- As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the game
- As a user, I want the game to be colourful and fun
- As a user, I want to see obvious and clear buttons to play the game
- As a user, I want to see a score board to see who wins the most games

## FEATURES

The Game consists of:

- A heading of TIC TAC TOE
  ![heading](/assets/images/testing/heading.png)

- A section explaining the rules of the game located underneath the heading.

![rules](/assets/images/testing/rules.png)

- A page with a 9 empty boxes that when clicked will display an X or and O depending on whose players turn it is.
- On the right of the game is the Score board to keep track of how many games Player X or Player O has won. (everyone time a player wins the score of the winning player will increase by 1)
  ![gameboard](/assets/images/testing/gameboard.png)

- At the bottom of the page is a restart game button which will clear the game board so the game can restart.

![restart](/assets/images/testing/restart.png)

- When the games ends with someone winning or the game being drawn a pop up message will appear as seen below.

  ![popup](/assets/images/testing/message.png)

- When the buttons are hovered over they brighten up to make the user aware they are on that button.

* FUTURE FEATURES:

- I would add a feature that would allow the user to play on their own against a computer.
- Another feature would be adding a time so each player only has a certain amount of time per move.
- I would add a feature which alternates the player starting first at the start of each game.
- I would add a feature to stop the first turn of each player being able to select the middle field on the game board.
- I would add a feature to allow the user to type in their own name instead of the Player X or Player O names.

* COLOR SCHEME

* I have used various colors that will draw the users to the key elements of the site

- The background color #2832C2
  ![Background](/assets/images/testing/backgroundblue.png)

- The Heading and Rules title color rgb(132, 130, 149)
  ![Heading](/assets/images/testing/headingcolor.png)

- The game board, background of the score board and restart button color
  ![Game board](/assets/images/testing/gameboard.png)

- The pop up message has a new game button which is colored #250645 with the text color #466289. It also has a winning message text color #ffd700
  ![popup message](/assets/images/testing/popupbackground.png)

  ![Winning text](/assets/images/testing/winningtext.png)

* TYPOGRAPHY

The fonts used for my website are 'Special-Elite' and 'Permanent Marker'. Special Elite is used for all the text and i have used the Permanent Marker for the X and O's on the game board. The font is imported from Google Fonts

# DEPLOYMENT

## REMOTE DEPLOYMENT:

(Assuming you have already cloned or forked)

- This Game was deployed using GitHub Pages with the following the steps:

1. Click on the `Settings` icon at the top of page in the navigation bar
2. Scroll down until you see `Github Pages`
3. There will be a message box saying `Check it out here` Click on the link to take you to the next page
4. Here you will be greated with a form, `Choose the repository` `Tic-Tac-Toe`
5. Choose the branch in the drop down box, in this case `MAIN`
6. Choose the directory in the next drop down box, in this case `Root`
7. Then click `Save`
8. It may take a few moments for the game to publish, but once live, the box at the top of the page with the site name will turn green and have a `Green` tick to the left of the link to the live page
9. Another way to find the live page is to navigate to settings, on the left menu click on `pages` and this will get you to the same point

- These commands were used for version control during project:

  - git add `example filename` - to add files before committing
  - git commit -m `"example message"` - to commit changes to the local repository
  - git push - to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository
  - git branch - to see which branch currently working on
  - git pull - to pull all code into main branch once the feature branch had been merged and deleted
  - git status - to see if the branch currently working on is upto date or if the are any unstaged
