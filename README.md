# DEPLOYMENT
## REMOTE DEPLOYMENT:
(Assuming you have already cloned or forked)
* This Game was deployed using GitHub Pages with the following the steps:

1. Click on the `Settings` icon at the top of page in the navigation bar
2. Scroll down until you see `Github Pages`
3. There will be a message box saying `Check it out here` Click on the link to take you to the next page
4. Here you will be greated with a form, `Choose the repository` `Javascript_PP2`
5. Choose the branch in the drop down box, in this case `MAIN`
6. Choose the directory in the next drop down box, in this case `Root`
7. Then click `Save`
8. It may take a few moments for the game to publish, but once live, the box at the top of the page with the site name will turn green and have a `Green` tick to the left of the link to the live page
9. Another way to find the live page is to navigate to settings, on the left menu click on `pages` and this will get you to the same point

* These commands were used for version control during project:

    * git add `example filename` - to add files before committing
    * git commit -m `"example message"` - to commit changes to the local repository
    * git push - to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository
    * git branch - to see which branch currently working on
    * git pull - to pull all code into main branch once the feature branch had been merged and deleted
    * git status - to see if the branch currently working on is upto date or if the are any unstaged

## HOW TO CREATE A BRANCH/TAG OF MAIN:

If you need to `BRANCH` off of the main repository:

1. If you have not already, login in to [GitHub](www.github.com) and go to https://github.com/Chr15w1986/Javascript_PP2
2. On the left side of the screen underneath the nav links, click the drop down box `Main`
3. Inside the box you will see `Create new branch/tag`
4. Inside the text box, enter the new branch or tag name i.e., `Features`
5. Below the Branches Tags tab, you will see `Create branch: Features from "main"`
6. Click on `Create branch: Features from "main"` and you will be taken to the new branch page you just called `Features`

## HOW TO FORK A REPOSITORY:

If you need to `FORK` a repository:

2. In the top right corner, click `Fork`
3. The next page will be the forked version of https://github.com/Chr15w1986/Javascript_PP2 but in your own repository
## HOW TO CLONE A REPOSITORY:

If you need to make a clone of this repository:

1. Fork the repository https://github.com/Chr15w1986/Javascript_PP2 using the steps above
2. Above the file list, click `Code` (Usually green at the top right of the code window)
3. Choose if you want to clone using HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI, then click the copy button to the right
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the directory to where you want your clone to go (your own github)
6. Type `git clone` and then paste the URL you copied in step 4
